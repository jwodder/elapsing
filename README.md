`elapsing` is a simple utility program that runs a given command and, while
it's running, displays & updates the elapsed time below the command's output.

Installation
============

In order to install `elapsing`, you first need to have [Rust and Cargo
installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).  You can then build the
latest version of `elapsing` and install it in `~/.cargo/bin` by running:

    cargo install --git https://github.com/jwodder/elapsing


Restrictions
============

`elapsing` is intended for use with commands with line-oriented output.  If it
is used with a command that outputs a large amount of data between newlines or
that manipulates the cursor, you'll have a bad experience.
